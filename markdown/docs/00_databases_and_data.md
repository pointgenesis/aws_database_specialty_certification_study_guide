# Data and Databases

 - `Data` is a collection of values or information.
 
 - A `Database` is an organized collection of data.
 
 There are three basic types of data:
 
 - Structured
 - Semi-structured
 - Unstructured
 
## Structured Data

Is stored in a table with a predefined structure or schema that is suitable for **Online Transactional Processing (OLTP)**
and/or **Online Analytical Processing (OLAP)**. The data is distributed into related tables using
foreign key relationships. Queries can use a **join** syntax to create more complex data relationships.

## Semi-structured Data

Data is organized, but does not have constraints related to a fixed schema, so various data 
structures are supported.


## Unstructured Data

## Metadata
 
While not technically a data structure, it's importance cannot be overlooked. Metadata 
describes other data. For example, a photo is typically combined with metadata such as
location and time taken. The metadata is structured data that is useful in analysis.  
 
 Different database types are needed to efficiently handle the different types of data.
